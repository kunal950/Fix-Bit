At our hostel, we noticed how time-consuming and manual the process was to get basic issues like broken windows or electrical problems resolved. 
To counter this, we created FixBit, a basic CRUD web app designed to simplify day-to-day problem resolution for students and hostel management.

## Features of FixBit:
- *User Login/Signup*: easy access for all users and admin.

- *Complaint Registration*: Users can register complaints with detailed descriptions and supporting images, thanks to Cloudinary for cloud storage.

- *Real-Time Communication*: Utilizing socket.io, FixBit optimizes advanced two-way communication for efficient real-time interactions between admins and users. This approach is far more effective than traditional polling, reducing latency and improving overall performance.

- *Admin Dashboard*: Admins can view complaints, update their status, and notify users in real-time.

- *Medical Assistance*: Direct chat feature with medical officers for health-related concerns.

- *Fuzzy Search*: Utilizes fuse.js for a lightweight, efficient, and effective search implementation, allowing users to quickly find relevant data even with partial or misspelled queries.

## Tech Stack:
- *Frontend*: React.js for a responsive and dynamic user interface.
- *Backend*: Node.js and Express.js to handle server-side logic and API calls.
- *Database*: MongoDB for robust and scalable data storage.
- *Real-Time Communication*: socket.io to enable seamless real-time interactions.
- *Cloud Storage*: Cloudinary for efficient image storage and management. By utilizing Cloudinary's client-side API calls, we offload image processing and storage from our backend, reducing server load and improving overall performance.
- *Deployment*: Leveraging Netlify and Render, we successfully deployed FixBit , learning essential deployment strategies and ensuring reliable availability for our users.

Working on FixBit from scratch has been immensely rewarding as a learning stage developer. It has taught us the invaluable skills of idea implementation, problem-solving, and collaboration with teammates Ambika Shivam Pandey and Ritwik Raj. Through this project, we've gained hands-on experience in the entire development lifecycle, from conceptualization to deployment.

This project is a starting prototype, and we look forward to enhancing it further to provide an even more comprehensive solution. The journey continues as we strive to incorporate new features and improvements based on user feedback and evolving needs.
